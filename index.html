			<h1>ECE 362 Microprocessor Systems and Interfacing</h1>
			<img class = "pImage" src = "images/holochess.PNG">
			
			<p>Course Description : </p>
			<p>An introduction to basic computer, organization, microprocessor instruction sets, assembly language programming, the design of various types of digital as well as analog interfaces, and microprocessor system design considerations. The accompanying laboratory is designed to provide practical hands-on experience with microprocessor software applications and interfacing techniques. Topics include design and implementation of a simple microcoded 3-bus computer; a detailed study of a particular microcomputer architecture and instruction set; assembly language programming techniques; system control signals and I/O structure; memory system design; I/O port design and handshaking protocols; interrupt control systems; parallel and serial interface subsystems; counter/timer subsystems; and analog (data and control) interfaces.</p>

			<h1>ECE 468 Intro to Compilers and Translation Engineering</h1>
			<img class = "pImage" src = "images/holochess.PNG">
			<p>Course Description : </p>
			<p>The design and construction of compilers and other translators. Topics include compilation goals, organization of a translator, grammars and languages, symbol tables, lexical analysis, syntax analysis (parsing), error handling, intermediate and final code generation, assemblers, interpreters, and an introduction to optimization. Emphasis is on engineering a compiler or interpreter for a small programming language - typically a C or Pascal subset. Projects involved the stepwise implementation (and documentation) of such a system.</p>
